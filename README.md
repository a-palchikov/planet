# Planet

Planet is a containerized Kubernetes environment. It is a self-containerizing Debian image with
Kubernetes services running inside. 

There are [official ways](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) to install and manage a Kubernetes cluster but `planet` is different in that:

* Planet creates a "bubble of consistency" for every cluster we deploy.
* Planet packages services running under/alongside Kubernetes.
* Planet facilitates easier remote updating of itself and Kubernetes.

It also happens to be a great way to play with Kubernetes!
Also check out the [developer documentation](docs/README.md).

## Installation

Planet images are automatically packaged by [gravity] - this is the easiest way to use and hack on planet.
See the development section below on details on how to build a planet image for [gravity].

## Details of Operation

Planet is a generic `container image` with executable entry points. Basically, it is an archived [root filesystem].
Inside a container image there are Kubernetes components specific to the image and the planet binary itself as `rootfs/usr/bin/planet`.

That `planet` binary defines all entry points for this package.

When you launch planet via `planet start`, it will self-containerize within its RootFS and start all Kubernetes
components using `[systemd]`.

Here is a brief summary of the planet interface:
```
Commands:
  help [<command>...]
    Show help.

  version
    Print version information

  start [<flags>]
    Start Planet container

  agent --leader-key=LEADER-KEY --election-key=ELECTION-KEY [<flags>]
    Start Planet Agent

  stop
    Stop planet container

  enter [<flags>] [<cmd>]
    Enter running planet container

  status [<flags>]
    Query the planet cluster status

  test --kube-addr=KUBE-ADDR [<flags>]
    Run end-to-end tests on a running cluster

  device add --data=DATA
    Add new device to container

  device remove --node=NODE
    Remove device from container

  etcd promote --name=NAME --initial-cluster=INITIAL-CLUSTER --initial-cluster-state=INITIAL-CLUSTER-STATE
    Promote etcd running in proxy mode to a full member

  leader pause
    Pause leader election participation for this node

  leader resume
    Resume leader election participation for this node

  leader view --leader-key=LEADER-KEY
    Display the IP address of the active master
```

## Hacking on Planet

### Building (installing from source)

Prerequisites for planet development are:
 - [docker] version >= 1.8.2 is required. For development, you need to be
   inside docker group and have the docker daemon running so the typical docker commands like `docker run`
   do not require sudo permissions. Here's official [docker configuration] reference.
 - (optional) [vagrant] version >= 1.7.4

The building process has been tested on `Debian 8` and `Ubuntu 15.04`.

The output of Planet build is a tarball that goes into `build/$TARGET`:

Following are the most common targets:

 - `make production` - builds a planet images. These are the images used by [gravity].

Building planet for the first time takes considerable amount of time since it has to download/build/configure
quite a few dependencies:
 - [kubernetes]
 - docker registry
 - [flannel]
 - [etcd]

Subsequent builds are much faster because intermediate results are cached (in `build/assets` directory).
To clear and rebuild from scratch, run the `make clean`.

### Upgrading dependencies

Sometimes we need to upgrade to a newer version of the specific dependency. This is relatively simple given
the modular approach to build assets. Most dependencies are encapsulated into their own build packages rooted
at `build.assets`.

For instance, to upgrade etcd, edit build.assets/makefiles/etcd/etcd.mk:

```Makefile
...
VER := v2.2.3
...
```

The version of [kubernetes] is defined in the root makefile:

```Makefile
...
KUBE_VER := v1.1.4
...
```

### Production Mode

[gravity] is the recommended way to deploy planet containers.
